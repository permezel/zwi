# zwi

Here are some small python programmes to facilitate viewing Zwift data.

# Requirements

    A Zwift account username and password
    python3
    pip3
    click
    zwift-client
    keyring
    pandas
    bokeh
    PyQt5

    pip3 install click
    pip3 install keyring
    pip3 install zwift-client
    pip3 install pandas
    pip3 install bokeh
    pip3 install PyQt5


# Usage

    ./zwi --help

## Authentication

    ./zwi auth --help
    ./zwi auth

The `auth` function will store the Zwift login credentials in the system keychain.
Once authentication has been established, the login credentials need not be passed on each invocation.

## Verification

    ./zwi check --help
    ./zwi check

The `check` function will verify that the stored credentials function.
On `MacOS`, normally, you will not have to enter the login password each time.
However, whenever the `python` interpreter changes, you will have to do so twice.  Make sure you click the `always allow` button.

## Initialise/Reset database

`zwi` maintains state in `${HOME}/.zwi/`.  An `sqlite3` database is used to cache the state of the user's `followers` and `followees` lists.
In addition, the profiles of all Zwift users encountered (via the `followers`/`followees` lists) are saved in a separate database.

    ./zwi reset --help
    ./zwi reset

The `reset` function deletes the `${HOME}/.zwi/zwi.db` database file if it exists, creates the `sqlite3` database, and populates the database with the `followers` and `followees` tables.
It will not delete the profiles database.

## Update followers/followees database

    ./zwi update --help
    ./zwi -v update

The `update` function refreshes the `followers` and `followees` information.
(Currently, this function is being fleshed out.  It does not yet report any differences. Also, it fails to profess deletions.)

## Update profile database

    ./zwi pro-update --help
    ./zwi [-v] pro-update [--force]

The `pro-update` function will update the local DB profile cache using information in the local Zwift user `followers` and `followees` DB cache.

## List profile database entries

    ./zwi pro-list --help
    ./zwi pro-list


## bokeh

    ./zwibok

The `profile` database can be viewed using the `zwibok` app.
This all needs to be rewritten soon, but is is somewhat functional.

## Gui

    ./zwi gui --help
    ./zwi gui

The `gui` function pops up a window displaying data from the local database copy of the Zwift `followers` and `followees` tables.

Key Bingings (for OSX):

    CMD-1  Switch to `followers` table.
    CMD-2  Switch to `followees` table.
    CMD-a  Toggle `auto` mode.
    CMD-n  Move to next entry.
    CMD-p  Move to previous entry.
    CMD-f  Search (not yet implemented).
    CMD-q  Quit

If `auto` mode is enabled:

    CMD-n  increase interval
    CMD-p  decrease interval

The slider at the bottom can be used to move rapidly thru the list.

For Linux, it appears the key bindings map to the CTRL key.  The menu items will indicate whatever it is.

## Followees

    ./zwi wees --help
    ./zwi wees

The `wees` function will check the cached followees list (them who's followed).
Any subject who is being followed but who is not reciprocating is displayed.
You will have to manually search for the user in the Zwift companion and decide what punishment to hand out.

## Followers

    ./zwi wers --help
    ./zwi wers

The `wers` function will check the cached followers list and display any lacking reciprocity.
Certain users will follow you, but not respond to reciprocal follow requests, remaining forever in limbo.
One can always try unfollowing/refollowing to see if the recalcitrant is interested in reciprocity.
As above, as far as I know, one has to use the Zwift companion app to search by name.

## Inspect other user's public information.

Per the Zwift privacy policy, various data are publicly accessible.  The `inspect` command
facilitates examination of the publicly available date.

    ./zwi inspect --help
    ./zwi inspect --zid=ZwiftUser
    ./zwi -v inspect --zid=ZwiftUser --update

## Removing authentication information

The `clear` function will remove any cached user/password information from the keystore.

# Hints


When manually deleting followees, using the Zwift companion app, and searching by name, I find it helps to type in the bits of the name which are more likely to be unique, so as to limit the lists presented.
